# StarWars
3rd college project from data structures course

The idea of this game is to create a battleship game like, but with Star Wars themed. You create your civilization around the universe and you gotta fight your enemies. 
This game is in multiplayer, using sockets. The frontend was created using Unity Engine, and the backend GoLang with gorilla web sockets.
